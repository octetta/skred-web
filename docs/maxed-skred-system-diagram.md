# Maxed SKRED System Diagram

This diagram represents the canonical POSIX `MAXED_KIT_OPTS` build. Windows
maxed presets omit the shared-memory scope node but retain recording, MIDI,
Ksynth, tracks, and track-aligned delays.

## Control Path

```mermaid

  host[Host command text]
  parser[Skode / ANDS parser]
  immediate[Immediate commands]
  compiled[Compiled opcode program]
  seq[Pattern steps]
  queue[Scheduled event queue]
  state[Synth / system state]

  host --> parser
  parser --> immediate --> state
  parser --> compiled
  compiled --> seq
  compiled --> queue
  immediate --> seq
  immediate --> queue
```

Text commands enter through `skred_command()` and run on the caller's control
thread. Commands that are safe for the real-time side compile into bounded
opcode programs; the audio callback never parses Skode text.

## Real-Time Path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  clock[(Atomic sample counter)]
  callback[Audio callback]
  seq[Sequencer]
  queue[Scheduled queue]
  exec[Run due opcodes]
  voices[Voice state]

  callback --> clock
  clock --> seq
  clock --> queue
  callback --> seq
  seq --> exec
  queue --> exec
  exec --> voices
```

The sequencer and scheduled queue share the sample counter. The callback splits
render blocks at event/pattern boundaries, runs due work, then renders the next
audio segment.

## Audio And Capture Path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  voices[Voices]
  dry[Dry stereo mix]
  stems[Stem routing\nr1..r4]
  delay[Stem delay buses\nds send]
  bus[10-channel bus]
  out[Device output]
  wav[Recorder WAV]
  shm[Scope shared memory]

  voices --> dry --> bus
  voices --> stems --> bus
  stems --> delay --> bus
  bus --> out
  bus --> wav
  bus --> shm
```

Voices always feed the stereo master unless disconnected. `r1` through `r4`
also route voices into four stereo stems. `ds` sends a centered, non-pan-modulated
voice into the delay line for its current stem; the wet delay returns to both
the master and that stem. The record/scope bus is 10 channels: master L/R plus
four stereo stems.

## Notification Path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  voices[Voice lifecycle]
  seq[Pattern yc1 boundaries]
  ce[Explicit ce markers]
  midi[MIDI input]
  ring[Control-event ring]
  host[Host poll / wait]
  dispatch[Optional /cer dispatcher]
  parser[Skode parser]

  voices --> ring
  seq --> ring
  ce --> ring
  midi --> ring
  ring --> host
  ring --> dispatch --> parser
```

- Scheduled opcode events are engine work waiting to happen.
- Control-plane events report observed activity: voice lifecycle, pattern
  boundaries, explicit `ce` markers, and optional MIDI input.
- Hosts consume notifications by polling or waiting on the control-event ring.
- The optional response dispatcher can consume matching events and submit bound
  Skode commands back through the control path. It also applies MIDI voice/pool
  routes and MIDI-to-Skode bindings after draining MIDI events.
